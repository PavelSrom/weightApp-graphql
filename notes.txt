I had a problem where when I had one log added and tried to choose
an exercise for the very first time, I was redirected to dashboard
but my statistics weren't showing

I think it's because when I chose the exercise, I updated the profile,
but in logs I was updating logs alone with the following query:
query {
	logs {
		...
	}
}

instead of:
query {
	profile {
		logs {
			...
		}
	}
}

- now that I use the second example, it works because now both update
the 'Profile' entity
